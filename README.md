# Docker Tutorial (Beginner)

## What is Docker?

Docker is a tool that allows developers, sys-admins etc. to easily deploy their applications in a sandbox (called *containers*) to run on the host operating system i.e. Linux. The key benefit of Docker is that it allows users to **package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardised unit** for software development. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not 
have high overhead and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources.
